Interactive Dashboard of COVID-19 infections and vaccinations employing [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io) module .
You can try [here](https://uscovid19vaccine-stats.streamlit.app/).

## Primary objectives
* Basic options for users to choose
  * Dataset Date Period
  * US State and County Multiselect Filters
  * Reads and updates Filter values usng Session State
  * A Home page and Multipage app to categorize the dataset at different hierarchy
     * US State Reports:
       * Display a Covid 19 Vaccination statistics for selected area (US or for specific State or County)
       * Draw a Rank Chart with the same selection (state-level or County-level comparisons)
     * NC Reports:
       * Draw a Violin Plot of Total Vaccination Count accross Age-Group and Gender
       * Draw a Bump Chart by Race over Time
       * Draw a Pie Chart by Ethnicity

## Data sources and helpful resources
* Vaccinations data source
  * [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data-with-Ge/n8mc-b4w4/about_data): COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Data with Geography dataset
* Geographic data
  * [Altair Vega_Datasets]([http://naturalearthdata.com/](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-datasets@v1.29.0/data/us-10m.json#)): Geographical shapedata for states and counties
  * counties <- alt$topo_feature(vega_data$us_10m$url, "counties")
  * states <- alt$topo_feature(vega_data$us_10m$url, "states")

## Descriptions of objects
* Geoshape Map
  * US states and counties map are drawn (Total number of vaccinated)
* Top Ranked Barplot
  * States on y-axis are pre-sorted by the Total vaccinated and displayed counties as stacked
* Violin Plot
  * For North Carolina State and its selected counties by Age-Group and Gender
* Bump Chart
  * For North Carolina State and its selected counties by Race over Time
* Pie
  * For North Carolina State and its selected counties by Ethnicity
